  <b>Implementations and Terminology</b>
</p>
<p>Terms used herein should be accorded their ordinary meaning in the relevant arts, or the meaning indicated by their use in context, but if an express definition is provided, that meaning controls.</p>
<p>&quot;Circuitry&quot; in this context refers to electrical circuitry having at least one discrete electrical circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one integrated circuit, electrical circuitry having at least one application specific integrated circuit, circuitry forming a general purpose computing device configured by a computer program (e.g., a general purpose computer configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes or devices described herein, or a microprocessor configured by a computer program which at least partially carries out processes or devices described herein), circuitry forming a memory device (e.g., forms of random access memory), or circuitry forming a communications device (e.g., a modem, communications switch, or optical-electrical equipment).</p>
<p>&quot;Firmware&quot; in this context refers to software

Magnetic media, electronic circuits, electrical and optical memory (both volatile and nonvolatile), and firmware are examples of

<p>Herein, references to &quot;one embodiment&quot; or &quot;an embodiment&quot; do not necessarily refer to the same embodiment, although they may. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, throughout the description and the claims, the words &quot;comprise,&quot; &quot;comprising,&quot; and the like are to be construed in an inclusive sense as opposed to an exclusive or exhaustive sense; that is to say, in the sense of &quot;including, but not limited to.&quot; Words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number respectively, unless expressly limited to a single one or multiple ones. Additionally, the words &quot;herein,&quot; &quot;above,&quot; &quot;below&quot; and words of similar import, when used in this application, refer to this application as a whole and not to any particular portions of this application. When the claims use the word &quot;or&quot; in reference to a list of two or more items, that word covers all of the following interpretations of the word: any of the items in the list, all of the items in the list and any combination of the items in the list, unless expressly limited to one or the other. Any terms not expressly defined herein have their conventional meaning as commonly understood by those having skill in the relevant art(s).</p>
